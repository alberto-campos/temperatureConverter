Temperature Converter

Temperature Converter - Assignment 1

A simple temperature converter that accepts a temperature number as an input.

The temperature entered will be understood as "Fahrenheits" by default.

The end user may change the temperature to convert into "Celcius" by touching that option.

The results will be calculated and displayed for both temperature formats, celcius and fahrenheit.

NOTE:
I used the old Tip Calcultor app for this assignment. So, some variable names and files will still say 'tip calculator'.
